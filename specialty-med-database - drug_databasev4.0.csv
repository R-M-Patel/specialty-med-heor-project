The drug is covalently linked to a ligand containing three N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) residues enabling targeted delivery to hepatocytes where 95% of circulating TTR is produced. Designed using Alnylam's enhanced stabilization chemistry (ESC) GalNAc-conjugate delivery platform vutrisiran achieves rapid TTR knockdown (mean steady-state reduction of 83%) with quarterly subcutaneous dosing.,Subcutaneous injection,25 mg administered by healthcare professional,Once every 3 months (quarterly),"[{""indication"":""Polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR-PN) in adults"",""approval_date"":""June 13 2022"",""notes"":""First FDA approval based on HELIOS-A trial""},{""indication"":""Cardiomyopathy of wild-type or hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR-CM) in adults"",""approval_date"":""March 20 2025"",""notes"":""sNDA approval based on HELIOS-B trial; reduces cardiovascular mortality hospitalizations and urgent HF visits""}]",Orphan Drug Designation (US/EU); Fast Track Designation (US); Priority Review,Vutrisiran was developed by Alnylam using ESC-GalNAc technology with Phase 3 HELIOS-A (hATTR-PN) completing in 2021 and HELIOS-B (ATTR-CM) in 2024 leading to FDA approvals in 2022 and 2025 respectively.,Alnylam Pharmaceuticals developed vutrisiran under an Alnylam-Sanofi agreement using the Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC) GalNAc-conjugate delivery platform. Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers demonstrated dose-dependent TTR reduction up to 80%. The Phase 3 HELIOS-A trial (NCT03759379) enrolled 164 patients at 57 sites in 22 countries starting in 2018 with positive 9-month topline results announced January 2021. FDA approved vutrisiran for hATTR-PN on June 13 2022. EMA approval for hATTR (Stage 1 or 2 polyneuropathy) followed in September 2022. The Phase 3 HELIOS-B trial (NCT04153149) enrolled 655 patients at 87 sites in 26 countries starting in 2019 with positive results presented at ESC Congress August 30 2024 and simultaneously published in NEJM.

Efficacy and safety of vutrisiran for patients with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis with polyneuropathy: a randomized clinical trial. Amyloid. 2023;30(1):18-26</a>",Hereditary Transthyretin-Mediated Amyloidosis (hATTR) with Polyneuropathy and Cardiomyopathy,hATTR amyloidosis is a rare progressive fatal inherited disease caused by TTR gene mutations leading to amyloid fibril deposition in nerves heart and other organs.,Hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR) is a rare autosomal dominant genetically inherited progressive and fatal disease caused by mutations in the TTR gene. Over 130 pathogenic TTR variants have been identified. The disease is characterized by the extracellular deposition of misfolded transthyretin protein as amyloid fibrils in multiple organs and tissues leading to progressive organ dysfunction and ultimately death. The condition presents with heterogeneous phenotypes including polyneuropathy-predominant cardiomyopathy-predominant or mixed manifestations.,Global prevalence is approximately 50000 individuals with symptomatic hATTR amyloidosis; US prevalence estimated at 10000-15000 cases with only 3000-4000 diagnosed.,The global prevalence of hATTR amyloidosis is estimated at approximately 50000 individuals with varying phenotypic presentations. In the United States an estimated 10000-15000 cases exist with approximately 3000-4000 diagnosed. ATTR-CM (including wild-type) affects approximately 150000 people in the US and over 300000 worldwide. The disease occurs in endemic regions (Portugal Japan Sweden) and sporadically worldwide. In the US the most common variants are Val122Ile (45%) Thr60Ala (20%) and Val30Met (~15%). The Val122Ile variant affects 3-4% of African Americans predominantly causing cardiac phenotype. Age of onset varies: TTR-FAP typically 30-50 years; ATTR-CM typically >60 years. Males show earlier onset higher penetrance and more cardiac involvement though inheritance is equal between genders.,"{""global_prevalence"":""~50000 symptomatic hATTR"",""us_prevalence"":""10000-15000 estimated; 3000-4000 diagnosed"",""us_attr_cm"":""~150000 (includes wild-type)"",""age_onset"":""TTR-FAP: 30-50 years; ATTR-CM: >60 years"",""gender_distribution"":""Equal inheritance; males have earlier onset higher penetrance more cardiac involvement"",""key_variants_us"":""Val122Ile (45%) Thr60Ala (20%) Val30Met (~15%)"",""val122ile_african_american"":""3-4% carrier frequency""}",TTR protein mutations destabilize the tetramer leading to monomer dissociation misfolding into beta-pleated sheets and aggregation into insoluble amyloid fibrils that deposit in tissues causing organ dysfunction.,TTR is a transport protein primarily synthesized in the liver that carries thyroxine and retinol. In hATTR mutations destabilize the TTR tetramer leading to dissociation into monomers that misfold into beta-pleated sheets and aggregate into insoluble amyloid fibrils. These fibrils deposit in tissues causing progressive organ dysfunction. Affected body systems include: peripheral nervous system (sensorimotor polyneuropathy) autonomic nervous system heart (cardiomyopathy arrhythmias heart failure) gastrointestinal tract (motility disorders malabsorption) kidneys eyes (vitreous opacities) and musculoskeletal system (carpal tunnel syndrome spinal stenosis).,Untreated hATTR has median survival of 4.7 years from diagnosis (3.4 years with cardiomyopathy) with significant quality of life impairment across all phenotypes.,Without treatment hATTR amyloidosis is uniformly fatal with median survival of 4.7 years from diagnosis. Patients with cardiomyopathy have worse prognosis with median survival of 3.4 years. Disease progression from symptom onset to death is typically 10-13 years for TTR-FAP. Patients experience significant quality of life impairment across all phenotypes compared to age-matched controls. Clinical manifestations include progressive sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy (pain paresthesias weakness orthostatic hypotension GI dysfunction) and/or restrictive cardiomyopathy with heart failure arrhythmias and conduction abnormalities.
